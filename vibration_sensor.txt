 Basic Operation 

4.1. Connection To Host 

 

Figure 4.1 Connection Example 

 

4.2. Precaution for Wiring and Cabling 

 This product has internal 120Ω terminator on the transmit/receive port (TD/RD). 
 It is recommended that twisted pair cable with shielding should be used. Each signal pair should be connected to each 

cable pair. (ex: RD+ and RD-) 
 It is recommended that shield connects to ground (at the host) when a cable with shield is used. 
 Maximum recommended cable length is 250 meters (460.8 kbps) as a guideline. However, even if the cable length is 

within the guidelines, the communication may be unstable or unusable depending on system environment. The cabling 
should be evaluated in the target system environment to confirm proper operation. (Ref: TIA-EIA-422-B ANNEX A) 

 

4.3. Precaution for Supplying Power 

The user should be aware of serious risks on the power supply exposure to the following: 
• High voltage noise by increased resistance and inductance on power supply line. 
• Surge voltage from lightning and environmental equipment. 

Figure 4.2 describes the external reference protection circuit against the lightning surge with a surge level based on 
IEC61000-4-5, +/-1 kV (power supply line to the power supply ground) and +/-2 kV (power supply line to the earth).

4.4. Operation Mode 

The following operational modes are available in the device. Sampling mode has two submodes: Manual mode and Auto 
mode. 

(1) Configuration mode 

(2) Sampling mode 

• Manual mode 

• Auto mode 

Immediately after a hardware reset or power-on, internal initialization starts. During the internal initialization, all the register 
values and states of external pins are undefined. After the internal initialization is completed, the device goes into 
Configuration mode automatically, except when AUTO_START and UART_AUTO sampling are both enabled (the device 
then goes into Sampling mode automatically). To change the operation mode, write to MODE_CMD (MODE_CTRL 
[0x02(W0)], bit [9:8]) (*1) and make various changes to the sensor setting in Configuration mode (*2). After configuration is 
completed, go to Sampling mode to read out the temperature and velocity/displacement data.  

By executing software reset (Register: GLOB_CMD [0x0A (W1)], write 1 to SOFT_RST in bit [7]), internal initialization 
operation is executed regardless of the current operation mode. 

When the UART interface is used, writing to UART_AUTO (UART_CTRL [0x08(W1)], bit [0]) can switch between Manual 
sampling and Auto sampling (*3).  

 

*1) The following explains register notation used in this document. 

For example, MODE_CTRL [0x02(W0)], bit [9:8] refers to: 

• MODE_CTRL: Register Name 

• [0x02(W0)]: First number is the Register Address, (W0) refers to Window Number “0” 

• bit [9:8]: Bits from 9 to 8 

 

*2) Make sure that the device is in Configuration mode when you write to the registers to configure operational settings. In 
Sampling mode, writing to registers is ignored except the following cases. 

• Writing to MODE_CMD (MODE_CTRL [0x02(W0)], bit [9:8]) 

• Writing to SOFT_RST (GLOB_CMD [0x0A(W1)], bit [7]) 

• Writing to WINDOW_ID (WIN_CTRL [0x7E(W0/W1)], bit [7:0]) 

 

*3) While the device is with UART Auto sampling and sensor sampling is active, register read access is not supported. 
Otherwise, the sampling data transmitted with the UART Auto sampling will be corrupted by the response data from the 
register read.

4.6. Sampling Counter 

1) 16-bit Counter 

By reading COUNT [0x0A(W0)] register, the counter value, which is incremented based on the sampling completion timing 
of the internal Analog Front End, can be read. The count interval timing is based on the precision of the internal reference 
oscillator (crystal): 

• For velocity: 1/6000 Sps ≒ 167 µs/count 

• For displacement: 1/600 Sps ≒ 1.67 ms/count 

Additionally, during UART burst mode or with UART Auto sampling, the counter value can be included in the response 
format by setting the COUNT_OUT (BURST_CTRL [0x0C(W1)], bit [1]). For information about the response format, see 5.2 
Data Packet Format. 

2) 2-bit Counter 

By reading 2BIT_COUNT of register: TEMP2 [0x2E(W0)], bit [1:0], a 2-bit count value that counts up at each output rate 
can be obtained. Also, the 2-bit count value can be included in the burst output by setting the TEMP_SEL of the register in 
SIG_CTRL [0x00(W1)], bit [1] to temperature format 2 and enabling the temperature output by the register setting in 
BURST_CTRL [0x0C(W1)], bit [14]. 

 

4.7. Self Test 

This product has the following self test functions. For information about the execution time of the self test, see “Self Test 
Time” in Table 1.4 Interface Specifications. 

⚫ Acceleration Value 

In this sensor, velocity / displacement outputs are provided based on the acceleration values. When there is no obvious 
abnormality, the acceleration values for X, Y, and Z axes should be within -32 m/s2 ~ 32 m/s2. Additionally, the net 
magnitude of the acceleration vector of X, Y, and Z axes acceleration values should be within 0 m/s2 ~ 32 m/s2 (these 
ranges appear to be wide because zero point calibration is not performed in this sensor for acceleration values). 

When performing the self test, make sure the device does not move during the test and the test is conducted in a place 
without vibration. 

To use this function, execute ACC_TEST of register: MSC_CTRL [0x02(W1)], bit [10], check the ACC_ERR_ALL of 
register DIAG_STAT1 [0x04(W0)], bit [1] for diagnostic result. The magunitude value of the 3-dimensional acceleration 
vector can be obtained by reading ACC_VEC of register: ACC_SELFTEST_DATA1 [0x2A(W0)], bit [7:0]. 

⚫ Sensitivity 

By utilizing the above ACC_VEC of register: ACC_SELFTEST_DATA1 [0x2A(W0)], bit [7:0] and the gravitational 
acceleration under the measurement environment, the validity of the sensitivity can be evaluated. Follow the procedure 
below with reference to Figure 4.6. 

① Place the sensor on a horizontal surface with the target axis parallel to the gravity direction. 
② Execut ACC_TEST of the register: MSC_CTRL [0x02(W1)], bit [10], read the acceleration value of the target axis from 

the register ACC_SELFTEST_DATA1 [0x2A(W0)] or the register: ACC_SELFTEST_DATA2 [0x2C(W0)]. 
③ Rotate the target axis 90 degrees to the horizontal plane, and perform ② again. 
④ Confirm that there is no obvious abnormality if the difference between the acceleration values in ② and ③ is within 

7.75 m/s2 ~ 11.75 m/s2.

Figure 4.6 Example of Sensor Placement for Sensitivity Test 

 
⚫ Temperature Value 

Determine whether the temperature sensor is operating properly. 

To use this function, execute TEMP_TEST of register: MSC_CTRL [0x02 (W1)], bit [9], check the TEMP_ERR of 
register: DIAG_STAT1 [0x04 (W0)], bit [9] for diagnostic result. 

⚫ Power Supply Voltage Level 

Determine whether the power supply voltage is within 3.0V to 3.6V. 

To use this function, execute VDD_TEST of register: MSC_CTRL [0x02(W1)], bit [8], check the VDD_ERR of register: 
DIAG_STAT1 [0x04(W0)], bit[8] for diagnostic result. 

⚫ Nonvolatile memory 

Determine whether the Nonvolatile memory is operating properly by consistency test of data in nonvolatile memory. 

To use this function, execute FLASH_TEST of register: MSC_CTRL [0x02(W1)], bit [11], check the FLASH_ERR of 
register: DIAG_STAT1 [0x04(W0)], bit [2] for diagnostic result. 

⚫ Structural Resonance Level 

Determine whether the input signal level amplified by the structural resonance is within the expected range. For the 
determination details, refer to Table 6.2 in "6.6 DIAG_STAT2 Register (Window 0)". 

Prior to the permanent installation of the sensor, the structural resonance level can be identified, which provides 
information for considering how to mount the sensor or where to place the sensor during the installation procedure. 

To use this function, execute EXI_TEST of register: MSC_CTRL [0x02(W1)], bit [15], check the EXI_LEVEL of register: 
DIAG_STAT2 [0x0C(W0)], bit [13:8] for diagnostic result. 

 

4.8. Threshold Detection 

When the sensor value exceeds the preset threshold, an alarm is displayed. The threshold value register is common for all 
output physical quantities, so make sure to set the threshold value according to the output physical quantity. The factory 
default setting of the threshold is the upper limit of the velocity output. 

The alarm threshold is set in the registers: XA_ALARM [0x47 - 0x46 (W1)], YA_ALARM [0x49 - 0x48 (W1)], ZA_ALARM 
[0x4B - 0x4A (W1)] and the alarm indication is registered in FLAG [0x06 (W0)], displayed in ALARM_ERR of bit [4:2]. 
Reading ALARM_ERR will reset the alarm display. 

Full Data Sheet Page 20 M-A542_DataSheet_E_Rev20220401 

 



 

M-A542VR1  

4.9. Structural Resonance Warning 

If strong vibration is applied at the structural resonance frequency band, which is outside the measurement band (see 
Cantilever Resonance Frequency in Table 1.3 Sensor Specifications), the input signal is amplified excessively due to the 
structural resonance of the cantilever beam, and measurement cannot be performed properly. Therefore, notification is 
made via the structural resonance warning flag when the measurement value becomes abnormal, and at the same time, the 
upper limit of the measurement range is output as the sensor value instead of the measurement value for warning. 

The structural resonance warning notification is displayed on EXI_ERR in Register: FLAG [0x06(W0)], bit [7:5] and on 
EXI_ERR in Register: TEMP2 [0x2E(W0)], bit [7:5]. Reading EXI_ERR will reset the warning notification. 

The structural resonance level determination function provided in the self test is useful for determining possible 
countermeasures against structural resonance. Refer to "4.7 Self Test" for details. 

 

4.10. Checksum 

A checksum can be appended to the response data during UART Burst mode or UART Auto sampling by enabling this 
function in CHKSM_OUT (BURST_CTRL [0x0C(W1)], bit [0]). 

The range of the data content for checksum is after the address byte (AD = 0x80) of the response data (Figure 4.7). The 
checksum is calculated with a simple addition of the data content in units of 16-bit, and the resulting sum is truncated to 16-
bits and appended as checksum just before delimiter byte (CR = 0x0D). Note that in the case of UART Burst Mode and 
UART Auto sampling, the upper word of the sensor data of each axis is 8 bits, these data should be added in 8 bits. 

Example 1) when the response data for UART Auto sampling is "8E00 0700 FF FFD8 00 007E 00 0296 1730", the total sum 
is "8E00+0700+FF+FFD8+00+007E+00+0296+1730=1B01B" resulting in a checksum of "B01B".

4.11. Automatic Start (For UART Auto Sampling Only) 

Automatic Start function is designed to be used in conjunction with the UART Auto sampling. When the power is supplied 
or the device is restart/reset, it allows the device to automatically enter Sampling mode after completing internal initialization. 
Please refer to Figure 4.3 for the state transition. 

Follow the procedures below to enable the Automatic Start function: 

• Write a “1” to both UART_AUTO (bit [0]) and AUTO_START (bit [1]) of UART_CTRL [0x08(W1)]. 

• Store the current register settings to non-volatile memory by writing a “1” to FLASH_BACKUP (GLOB_CMD 
[0x0A(W1)], bit [3]). After completion of the FLASH_BACKUP command, confirm the results by FLASH_BU_ERR 
(DIAG_STAT1 [0x04(W0)], bit [0]). 

• The device will automatically enter Sampling Mode after the power supply is cycled, or a hardware reset, or a software 
reset command is executed. 

Follow the procedures below to disable this function. 

• After entering sampling mode with automatic start, write "01" to MODE_CMD of register: MODE_CTRL [0x02 (W0)], bit 
[9:8] and enter the configuration mode. 

• Write "0" to AUTO_START of register: UART_CTRL [0x08 (W1)], bit [1]. 

• The subsequent steps are the same as above to store the register setting to nonvolatile memory and restart or reset 
the device.

4.12. Frequency Response Characteristics 

The frequency response characteristics of this device are shown in Figure 4.8 and Figure 4.9.

Figure 4.9 Frequency Response Characteristics (Displacement Output) 

 

To achieve the above frequency response characteristics, two FIR filters (512-tap BPF, 256-tap HPF) are used in this 
product. For this reason, the transient response of the filters is produced at the start of measurement. During this period, the 
velocity value register: VELC [0x3A-0x30(W0)] and the displacement value register: DISP [0x3A-0x30(W0)] are not updated. 
In the case of UART Auto measurement, the output starts after the number of transient response samples elapses from the 
start of measurement. Table 4.1 shows the total transient response time of FIR filters at the start of measurement.

M-A542VR1  

4.13. Velocity and Displacement Output 

Either velocity output or displacement output can be selected in this product. The velocity output is calculated in the time 
domain by integrating the acceleration data measured by the crystal acceleration sensor. Displacement output is calculated 
by double integrating the acceleration data. 

Instead of the velocity / displacement raw data output, you can also select to output velocity / displacement RMS (effective 
value) or P-P (peak-to-peak value). The RMS data is the root mean square of the velocity or displacement RAW data calculated 
for each of the 16 taps, averaged over the interval of UPDATE_RATE_RMSPP in Register: SMPL_CTRL [0x04(W1)], bit [7:0], 
and output in the interval of DOUT_RATE_RMSPP in Register: SMPL_CTRL [0x04(W1)], bit [15:8]. P-P data is calculated as 
the difference between the maximum and minimum values of velocity or displacement data in the time interval of 
UPDATE_RATE_RMSPP and output in the time interval of DOUT_RATE_RMSPP. 

(1) Transient Response of Integral Filter 

Note that when starting measurement, or when the sensor placement attitude changes considerably for some reason, there 
will be a transient response in the integral filter output due to bias fluctuation. Figures 4.10-13 show examples of transient 
responses.

(2) How to switch the output physical quantity 

The factory default setting is velocity output. To switch the output physical quantity, set the desired output physical quantity 
in OUTPUT_SEL of the register: SIG_CTRL [0x00(W1)], bit [7:4]. After writing to OUTPUT_SEL, OUTPUT_STAT at bit [0] 
changes to "1" (running), and when the setting is complete, OUTPUT_STAT returns to "0". For the setting duration, refer to 
Output Mode Setting Time in Table 1.4 Interface Specifications. 

Note) Do not write to the registers while the output physical quantity is being switched. 

Note) If the switching of the output physical quantity fails, the setting will not be changed and an error will be displayed in 
HARD_ERR of the register: DIAG_STAT1 [0x04(W0)], bit [7:5].

4.14. Alignment Compensation 

By reading alignment compensation coefficients stored in the dedicated registers and applying alignment compensation by 
the host on the measured values, the 3-axis alignment accuracy can be improved. 

The procedure for reading the alignment correction coefficients and the formulas for the alignment compensation are as 
follows. 
 

(1) Formulas for applying alignment compensation 

Px = MxDx + MxyDy + MxzDz 

Py = MyxDx + MyDy + MyzDz 

Pz = MzxDx + MzyDy + MzDz 

*1) P: Alignment compensated values, M: Alignment compensation coefficients (32 bit), D: Measured values (32 bit) 

*2) Alignment compensation coefficient data format 
32-bit two's complement format 

bit 31 : sign 
bit 30 ~ 23 : integer 
bit 22 ~ 0 : decimal 

 

(2) Alignment compensation coefficients read-out procedure 

1. First, set the coefficient address to ALIGN_ADDR in Register: ALIGNMENT_COEF_ADDR [0x3C(W1)], bit [7:0].  

2. Next, write "0x01” (Read) to ALIGN_CMD in Register: ALIGNMENT_COEF_CMD [0x38(W1)] bit [1:0] to perform 
coefficient reading. 

3. Next, read the coefficient data (16 bits) from ALIGN_DATA in Register: ALIGNMENT_COEF_DATA [0x3A(W1)], 
bit [15:0]. When the reading is completed, the address is automatically incremented, thus enabling continuous 
execution of the reading command (step 2). 

The reading sequence (Figure 4.14) and the memory map of the coefficients (Table 4.2) are shown below.

 Digital Interface 

The registers inside the device are accessed via the RS-422 interface. 

In this document, data sent to the device is called a “Command” and data sent back in response to the command is called a 
“Response”. There are two types of commands: write command and read command. The write command has no response. 
The write command always writes to the internal register in 8-bit words. The response to the read command, i.e. the data 
from the internal register, is always read in 16-bit words. 

When reading from the registers, there is a burst mode in addition to the normal mode. 

When the output data size is large, it may exceed the bandwidth of the host interface and cause the data transmission to be 
incorrect. In this case, the user must balance the transmission data rate and the bandwidth capability of the host interface. 

Adjust the following settings accordingly to optimize the host interface bandwidth: 

• For the UART, adjust the baud rate in BAUD_RATE (UART_CTRL [0x08(W1)], bit [9:8]). 

Adjust the following settings accordingly to optimize the transmission data rate: 

• The transmission data rate is also affected by the number of output bytes included in burst mode read transfer. The 
adjustment to the number of output bytes is in registers BURST_CTRL [0x0C(W1)]. 

Several concrete examples for setting the transmission data rate and host interface bandwidth are shown below. For the 
selection of the read out mode for the host interface bandwidth, refer to "5.3 Recommended Control Conditions". 
 

 ① When the output data size is small (output data example: Temperature, XYZ) 

• BAUD_RATE = “01" of UART_CTRL [0x08(W1)], bit [9:8]: 460800 baud 
• UART_AUTO = “1" of UART_CTRL [0x08(W1)], bit [0]: UART Auto sampling 
• BURST_CTRL [0x0C(W1)] = “0x4700”: TEMP and Velocity-XYZ output 

 ② When the output data size is large (output data example: Flag, temperature, XYZ, COUNT, checksum) 

• BAUD_RATE = “00" of UART_CTRL [0x08(W1)], bit [9:8]: 921600 baud 
• UART_AUTO = “1" of UART_CTRL [0x08(W1)], bit [0]: UART Auto sampling 
• BURST_CTRL [0x0C(W1)] = “0xC703”: FLAG, TEMP, Velocity-XYZ, COUNT, and CHECKSUM output

For the UART interface, a delimiter (1 byte) is placed at the end of each command (by the host) and response (by this 
device). In addition for responses, the address (1 byte) specified by the command is added (by this device) to the beginning 
of the response.

5.1.1. UART Read Timing (Normal Mode) 

The response to the read command, i.e. the data from the internal register, is always returned 16-bit data at a time. The 
register address (AD) comes at the beginning of the response, for example, 0x02 for the MODE_CTRL [0x02(W0)] register.

5.1.2. UART Read Timing (Burst Mode) 

Burst mode access of read data is supported using a “Burst Read Command” by writing 0x00 in BURST_CMD (BURST  
[0x00(W0)], bit [7:0]). In Burst Mode, ND/EA flag, temperature value, 3-axis velocity value, etc. are consecutively sent as a 
response. The response format for the burst read output data is configured by register setting in BURST_CTRL [0x0C(W1)].

5.1.4. UART Auto Sampling Operation 

When UART Auto sampling is active, all sensor outputs are sent as burst transfer automatically at the programmed output 
data rate without the request from the Host. For information about the response format, see 5.2 UART Data Packet Format. 
The response format for the burst read output data is configured by register setting in BURST_CTRL [0x0C(W1)].

5.3. Recommended Communication Conditions 

To ensure that the output data bandwidth does not exceed the bandwidth capability of the host UART interface, select the 
output physical quantity, output data size, communication speed, and read out mode respectively according to the purpose 
of use. Table 5.10 and Table 5.11 show the selection matrices for typical output data sizes. 

When sampling velocity RAW output with the maximum data size (19 Bytes), only 921.6 kbps is available for a 
communication speed. In particular, when sampling the velocity RAW output with the initial data size (13 bytes), 
communication at 460.8 kbps is available in AUTO mode (not available when reading out in BURST mode).

M-A542VR1  

 User Register 

A host device (for example, a microcontroller) can control the device by accessing the control registers inside the device. 

The registers are accessed in this device using a WINDOW method. The prescribed window number is first written to 
WINDOW_ID of WIN_CTRL [0x7E(W0/W1)], bit [7:0], then the desired register address can be accessed. The WIN_CTRL  
[0x7E(W0/W1)] register can always be accessed without needing to set the window number. 

During the Power-On Start-Up Time or the Reset Recovery time specified in the Table 1.4 Interface Specifications, all the 
register values are undefined because internal initialization is in progress. Ensure the device registers are only accessed 
after the Power-On Start-Up Time or the Reset Recovery time is over. 

For information about the initial values of the control registers after internal initialization is finished, see the “Default” 
column in the Table 6.1. The control registers with ○ mark in the “Flash Backup” column can be saved to the non-
volatile memory by the user, and the initial values after the power on will be the values read from the non-volatile memory. If 
the read out from the non-volatile memory fails, the FLASH_ERR (DIAG_STAT1 [0x04(W0)], bit [2]) is set to 1 (error). 

Please ensure that the device is in the Configuration Mode before writing to registers. In the Sampling Mode, writing to 
registers is ignored except for the following cases. 

• MODE_CMD in MODE_CTRL [0x02(W0)], bit [9:8] 
• SOFT_RST in GLOB_CMD [0x0A(W1)], bit [7] 
• WINDOW_ID in WIN_CTRL [0x7E(W0/W1)], bit [7:0] 

While in the UART Auto Mode with Sampling Mode is active, register read access is not supported. Otherwise, the 
sampling data transmitted in the UART Auto Mode will be corrupted by the response data from the register read. 

Each register is 16-bit wide and one address is assigned to every 8 bits. Registers are read in 16-bit words and are written 
in 8-bit words. The byte order of each 16-bit register is little endian, but the byte order of the 16-bit data transferred over the 
digital interface is big endian. 

Table 6.1 shows the register map, and Section 6.1 through Section 6.28 describes the registers in detail. 

The “-” sign in the register assignment table in Section 6.1 through Section 6.28 means “reserved”. 
Write a “0” to reserved bits during a write operation. 
During a read operation, a reserved bit can return either 0 or 1 (“don’t care”). 
Writing to a read-only register is prohibited. 

 
Note) The explanation of the register notation MODE_CTRL [0x02(W0)], bit [9:8] is as follows: 

• MODE_CTRL: Register name 
• [0x02(W0)]: First number is the Register Address, (W0) means Window Number “0” 
• bit [9:8]: Bits 9 to 8

  Tx = {0xFE,0x00,0x0d}.  /* Write to WIN_CTRL (L) to set WINDOW_ID = 0 */ 
  Tx = {0x04,0x00,0x0d}.  /* Read out DIAG_STAT1 */ 
  Rx = {0x04,MSByte,LSByte,0x0d}. /* Retrieve the response value */ 
  // If HARD_ERR is 000, the hardware check completes successfully; if not, an error occurred. 
 

7.1.2. Register Read and Write (UART) 

Register Read Example 

(a) Read 16-bit data from the register (Address = 0x02 / Window = 0).

  Tx = {0x02, 0x00, 0x0d}.  /* Read out MODE_CTRL */ 
  Rx = {0x02, 0x04, 0x00, 0x0d}. /* Retrieve the response value */ 

// The 2nd byte of Rx data “0x04” indicates a configuration mode. 
// The 3rd byte of Rx data “0x00” indicates Reserved. 
// Read data is by 16 bits with MSB first format. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Register Write Example 

(a) Write 8-bit data to the register (Address = 0x03 / Window = 0). 
Tx = {0xFE, 0x00, 0x0d}.  /* Write to WIN_CTRL (L) to set WINDOW_ID = 0 */ 

  Tx = {0x83, 0x01, 0x0d}.  /* Write to MODE_CTRL (H) to go to Sampling mode */ 
 // No corresponding response for data writing. 
 // Write data is by 8 bits.

      temperature format 2 */ 
(b) Wait until the setting is completed. 

// Wait for the time specified in “Output Mode Setting Time”, 
// Or verify OUTPUT_STAT of register: SIG_CTRL [0x00(W1)], bit [0] returns to 0 as shown below. 

  Tx = {0x00, 0x00, 0x0d}.  /* Read out SIG_CTRL */ 
  Rx = {0x00, MSByte, LSByte, 0x0d}. /* Retrieve the response value */ 
  // If OUTPUT_STAT is 0, the setting is complete; if 1, the setting is in progress and (b) needs to be repeated. 
  // Note) Do not write to the register while the setting is being executed. 
(c) Confirm the setting result. 

// Check HARD_ERR in register: DIAG_STAT1 [0x04(W0)], bit [7:5]. 
Tx = {0xFE, 0x00, 0x0d}.  /* Write to WIN_CTRL (L) to set WINDOW_ID = 0 */ 

  Tx = {0x04, 0x00, 0x0d}.  /* Read out DIAG_STAT1 */ 
  Rx = {0x04, MSByte, LSByte, 0x0d}. /* Retrieve the response value */

8.1. Cautions for Use 

• When you attach the product to a housing, equipment, jig, or tool, make sure you attach it properly so that no mechanical 
stress is added to create a distortion such as a warp or twist. In addition, tighten the screws firmly but not too firmly because 
the mount of the product may break. Use screw locking techniques as necessary. 

• When you set up the product, make sure the equipment, jigs, tools, and workers maintain a good ground in order not to 
generate high voltage leakage. If you add overcurrent or static electricity to the product, the product may be damaged 
permanently. 

• When you install the product, make sure metallic or other conductors do not enter the product. Otherwise, malfunction or 
damage of the product may result. 

• If excessive shock is added to the product when, for example, the product falls, the quality of the product may be degraded. 
Make sure the product does not fall when you handle it. 

• Before you start using the product, test it in the actual equipment under the actual operating environment. 
• Since the product has capacitors inside, inrush current will occur during power-on. Evaluate in the actual environment in 

order to check the effect of the supply voltage drop by inrush current in the system. 
• If water enters the product, malfunction or damage of the product may result. If the product can be exposed to water, the 

system must have a waterproof structure. We do not guarantee the operation of the product when the product is exposed 
to condensation, dust, oil, corrosive gas (salt, acid, alkaline, or the like), or direct sunlight. 

• This product is not designed to be radiation resistant. 
• Never use this product if the operating condition is over the absolute maximum rating. If you do, the characteristics of the 

product may never recover. 
• If the product is exposed to excessive exogenous noise or the like, degradation of the precision, malfunction, or damage 

of the product may result. The system needs to be designed so that the noise itself is suppressed or the system is immune 
to the noise. 

• Mechanical vibration or shock, continuous mechanical stress, rapid temperature change, or the like may cause cracks or 
disconnections at the various connecting parts. 

• Take sufficient safety measure for the equipment this product is built into. 
• This product is not intended for general use by the consumer but instead for engineering design. For the customer, please 

consider it safely with the proper use. 
• This product is not designed to be used in the equipment that demands extremely high reliability and where its failure may 

threaten human life or property (for example, aerospace equipment, submarine repeater, nuclear power control equipment, 
life support equipment, medical equipment, transportation control equipment, etc.). Therefore, Seiko Epson Corporation 
will not be liable for any damages caused by the use of the product for those applications. 

• Do not alter or disassemble the product. 
 

8.2. Cautions for Storage 

• Do not add shock or vibration to the packing box. Do not spill water over the packing box. Do not store or use the product 
in the environment where dew condensation occurs due to rapid temperature change. 

• To suppress the characteristic change by prolonged storage, it is recommended to maintain the environment at normal 
temperature and normal humidity. Normal temperature: +5 ~ +35 °C Normal humidity: 45 %RH ~ 85 %DH (JIS Z 8703). 

• Do not store the product in a location subject to High Temperature, high humidity, under direct sunlight, corrosive gas or 
dust. 

• Do not put mechanical stress on the product while it is stored. 
 

8.3. Other Cautions 

• The product contains quartz crystal oscillator created by microfabrication. Take precaution to prevent falling or excessive 
impact. Do not use the product after an accidental fall or it experiences excessive impact. The possibility of a failure and 
risk of malfunction from failure increases. 

• Small performance deterioration due to long-term use and aging effects, etc. cannot be detected through the self-diagnosis 
test in this product. Discontinue use immediately even when the self-diagnosis test results in a “pass” when experiencing 
abnormality in the sensor performance. 

• If environmental vibration is expected in the resonance frequency band of this product, take sufficient countermeasures 
before use. 

• If a radio (transmission antenna) is set up near this product, degradation of the precision may result by radio frequency

M-A542VR1  

interference. Place the radio (transmission antenna) as far away as possible or add shielding to mitigate the effects of radio 
frequency interference. 

• Please turn off the power of the related equipment when cabling. 
• This product has an IP67 protection structure. Cannot be used underwater for constant use. Note that if the connector is 

not fitted properly or if a connector with insufficient protection is used, the connection may not satisfy the IP67 protection 
level.  

• This unit is waterproof and dustproof in conformance with IP67, and operation is not guaranteed in environments exceeding 
this standard (submersion in water, condensation, dust), and under environments where the unit is exposed to oil, or 
incorrosive gases (salt, acid, alkali, etc.).  

• When mating the connector, insert the connector into the mating part sufficiently, and then tighten the screw of the connector 
part sufficiently. If not tightened sufficiently, the IP67 protection level may not be satisfied. 

• Do not use the product in a condition where external force is constantly applied to the connector joint.  
• Confirm the name and polarity of the pins and connect them properly when wiring to the connector pins.  
• The power supply to this product must satisfy the voltage rating within 2 seconds after it is turned on. 
• Do not use thinner or similar liquids on this product. When cleaning this product, alcohol may be used. 
• Maximum recommended cable length is 250 meters (460.8 kbps) as a guideline. However, even if the cable length is within 

the guidelines, the communication may be unstable or unusable depending on system environment. The cabling should be 
evaluated in the target system environment to confirm proper operation. Communication cables conforming to the EIA (RS-
422) standard is recommended (Ref: TIA-EIA-422-B ANNEX A).  

• In general, when a vibration sensor is mounted on a target machine, resonance is generated due to contact. In particular, 
if there is a rattle in the mounting, the resonance caused by the contact will deteriorate the measurement accuracy. To 
prevent this, it is recommended to screw the product firmly to the machine to be measured. 
 

8.4. Limited Warranty
